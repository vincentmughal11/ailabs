IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Return ONLY raw JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no backticks. Your response must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.
- Keep descriptions SHORT (1-2 sentences max, under 20 words)
- Prompts must be written in FIRST-PERSON PAST TENSE, as if the user has already taken the action
- Prompts should describe what the user DID, not commands for what they should do
- Prompts should end with uncertainty or a question to invite model response

Format your response as a JSON array with objects containing: title, description, and prompt.`

Conversation History:
${conversationHistory.map(msg => `${msg.role}: ${msg.content}`).join('\n')}

Model A Response: ${modelResponses.modelA}

Model B Response: ${modelResponses.modelB}

Based on these two different AI responses, generate 3 next step choices that:
1. Are written in FIRST-PERSON PAST TENSE, describing what the user already did based on the model advice
2. Reference specific advice or suggestions from BOTH models
3. Show what action the user took as a result of the advice
4. PROVIDE FULL CONTEXT - explain WHO they talked to, WHAT they said, WHERE they went, etc.
5. End with uncertainty, a question, or "But then..." to invite the next model response
6. Create meaningful story progression

CRITICAL: The prompt must include specific details about the action taken - WHO was involved, WHAT was said/done, WHERE it happened. Don't leave details vague.

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
BAD: "They encouraged me to stand my ground, but now I'm unsure if I should still reach out to my friend..."
GOOD: "So I reached out to my friend Sarah like you suggested and asked her if she could help me with this situation. I mentioned what you said about standing my ground, and explained the context to her. She said she'd think about it, but then asked me something that made me reconsider..."

BAD: "I called and explained the situation."
GOOD: "I dialed the landlord's office number like you recommended and spoke to the property manager, Ms. Johnson. I calmly explained the noise situation to her, mentioned how it was affecting my sleep for my job interview, and referenced what both of you said about documenting everything. But then she told me something that changed everything..."

Each choice should provide a complete, specific picture of what happened in the next step, not just vague feelings about it.`
